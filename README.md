# Decision Tree From Scratch
* Decision Tree model developed in python from scratch on the iris dataset - the algorithm itself is built solely with numpy and built-in Python modules;
* Uses the shannon entropy to calculate the information gain to find the best feature and threshold per node;
* Graph developed from scratch using matplotlib, and displays the tree created by the training data with the results of the test data - however, this should be further refined, as a larger graph could lead to overlapping nodes;
* Outputs the accuracy (found on the graph).

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.8

**Packages:** numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for splitting the data, importing the dataset, and to calculate accuracy)
